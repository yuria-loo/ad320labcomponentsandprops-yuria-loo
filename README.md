## 4. Dynamically Render Data

- In `RecipeContainer`, access the recipe data through props
- Use `.map()` to loop through the recipes and render a `Recipe` component for each item
- Pass each individual recipe to the `Recipe` component as a prop
- In `Recipe`, access the data through props and render the content using JSX

5. Style the components

- Style the components however you like, have fun!
